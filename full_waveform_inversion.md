# FULL WAVEFORM INVERSION

##  Full waveform inversion is a high resolution seismic imaging technique 
that is based on using the entire content of seismic traces for extracting
physical parameters of the medium sampled by seismic waves.

## Forward simulation
### Absorbing boundary conditions for the numerical simuation of waves [Bjorn Engquist][1]

When calculating solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) it is often
essential to introduce artificial boundaries to limit the area of computation.
We needs boundary conditions at these artificial boundaries in order to guarantee
a unique and well-posed solution to the differential equation.
